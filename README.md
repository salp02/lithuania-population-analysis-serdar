# Lithuania Population Analysis (1990–2024)

### Author: Serdar Alp Küçükoğlu  
### Course: Solving a Problem Using Open Data  
### Dataset: Eurostat – Population on 1 January by age and sex  
### Purpose: Analyze Lithuania’s long-term population decline using open data and Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project examines Lithuania’s population decline between **1990 and 2024** using publicly available open data from **Eurostat**.  
The aim is to process, visualize, and interpret long-term demographic trends using reproducible Python code.

Lithuania is among the fastest-shrinking countries in the European Union, making this analysis socially and economically relevant.

## 📊 Key Research Questions

- How has Lithuania’s population changed from 1990 to 2024?  
- What is the total population loss over the last 34 years?  
- Which years experienced the most dramatic decline?  
- What are the long-term risks for the country?

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

**Data Source:**  
Eurostat – *Population on 1 January by age and sex*  
Link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat

**Downloaded Format:** SDMX-CSV (.csv)

**Filtered Dataset Includes:**
- `geo = LT` (Lithuania)  
- `sex = T` (Total)  
- `age = TOTAL`  
- `TIME_PERIOD = 1990–2024`  

**Schema (after cleaning):**

| Column       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| year         | Observation year |
| population   | Total population (Lithuania) |
| abs_change   | Yearly absolute population change |
| pct_change   | Yearly percent change |

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing Steps

The following operations were applied:

1. Load Eurostat SDMX-CSV using Pandas  
2. Filter Lithuania (LT), total age & sex  
3. Convert column names  
4. Convert year and population to numeric  
5. Select only years 1990–2024  
6. Compute:
   - Yearly absolute change  
   - Yearly percent change  
7. Prepare analysis-ready DataFrame

## 📈 Visualizations (Generated by Python)

The project produces three main visualizations:

1. **Population Trend (1990–2024)**  
   → <img width="987" height="590" alt="lt_population_trend" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b294b5-4f7b-4055-8cd8-385aef1c435d" />


2. **Yearly Absolute Population Change**  
   → `lt_population_abs_change.png`

3. **Yearly Percent Population Change**  
   → `lt_population_pct_change.png`

All plots are saved automatically in the project directory when running the notebook.

## 🔍 Summary of Findings

- Lithuania’s population decreased from **3.69 million (1990)** to **2.68 million (2024)**  
- Total loss: **–887,817 people**  
- Average yearly change: **–0.720%**  
- Worst population loss year: **2011 (–89,388 people)**  
- Main causes:
  - Emigration
  - Low fertility rates
  - Aging population
  - Post-Soviet demographic transition

## 🧠 Policy Implications

- Need for skilled immigration  
- Youth retention strategies  
- Family and childcare incentives  
- Long-term pension system planning
